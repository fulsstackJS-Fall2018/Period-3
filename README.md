# Period-3 

### Using Geo-information on clients and servers


*In this period we will refresh our knowledge related to React Native mainly focusing on geo-location features, Introduce GeoJSON, and how to use it with MongoDB, and continue with the mini project*

## [Learning Goals Period 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12WHBIzeT0mh0ZWmwFKufTJFTdQy007sZich9XWApW48/edit?usp=sharing)

## 22-10-Monday
* A quick introduction Geo-location and GeoJSON 
* How to use geospatial queries in MongoDB (using mongoose)

#### Before this lesson you should read these two articles:
- [More than you ever wanted to know about GeoJSON](https://macwright.org/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite)
- Skim the [Geospatial Queries](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/geospatial-queries/)


**Exercises:** 
[Getting Started with GeoJSON](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AmOU_c_ELEyn522X1j8rFnfUAt7u8fMpvH7t-KshS1s/edit?usp=sharing) (wee will do this together in the class, or at least get started)

GeoJson and Geospatial Queries Continued

#### Before this lesson you should read/skim:
- [Quick guide to MongoDB Geospatial Queries](http://thecodebarbarian.com/80-20-guide-to-mongodb-geospatial-queries)
- [Using GeoJson](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/geojson.html) (links to the document above)
- Skim only [GeoSpatial Queries](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/geospatial-queries/#geospatial-indexes) (The official MongoDB documentation)

**Exercises:**

## 5-11 - Monday

React Native Recap, speciallly focused on Geolocation

### Before this lesson you should:
Make sure, before this lesson, to refresh your knowledge related to React Native.

Check that you have installed the required [tools](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/) and make sure to bring an up-to-date phone for the lesson. 

Try, before tomorrow, to create a simple app, and execute it on your phone.
Skim the documentation for these two Expo-APIs which are both necessary for the mini project.

- [Location](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v26.0.0/sdk/location)
- [Map-View](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v26.0.0/sdk/map-view)



**Exercises:**

## 12-11 Monday

### Before this lesson you should (Yellow, Red Students only):
[Expo Push Notifications](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v31.0.0/guides/push-notifications) Read about Push Notification, and how easy it is to get started with Expo

_Primarily the last two days in this period should be spent on the mini-project. Unless you plan to end in the (very) low end of the grading scale, it must be deployed (backend on DO, and mobile client to expo). You will be expected to demo your solution if to "draw" this topic for the exam._
